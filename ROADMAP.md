**Current:** `main` @ v0.3 post-Phase F · 84 tests · 8 workspaces · CI not yet
**Horizon:** v0.4 → v1.0, roughly one milestone per 1–2 weeks of evenings

---

## Practice OS Runtime Overlay

The Practice OS strategic backlog uses Hub as runtime support, not practice
source of truth. See `docs/PRACTICE_OS_RUNTIME_READINESS.md` before expanding
intake, console, prompt, webhook, retrieval, or hosted runtime behavior for the
consulting practice.

Keep v0.4 hardening first. Memory retrieval and Hub-as-MCP-server stay later
until DTP Knowledge Base V1 and privacy/citation gates exist.

## How to use this doc

- Each milestone has a **goal**, a **PR table**, **acceptance criteria**, and **out of scope**.
- PRs are sized to ≤500 LOC and ordered so gates stay green between merges.
- Tick boxes as you merge. When a PR's scope changes, edit the row — don't append a new one.
- When a milestone slips, move unfinished rows down, don't renumber.
- Reprioritize by reordering the milestone blocks. Anything labeled **V1+** lives in §7.

### Global invariants (never weaken)

1. Privacy router: `sensitivity=high` NEVER hits Anthropic. `maxSensitivity` always wins.
2. Obsidian = prose. Notion = structured DBs. SQLite = ops/telemetry. No collapsing.
3. No breaking changes to webhook URLs, CLI command names, or `x-hub-secret` header shape without a major bump + migration note.
4. No new heavyweight deps (LangGraph, Mastra, Prisma, Redis, Docker, Postgres) — see `DECISIONS.md`.
5. Solo maintainer reality: Windows arm64 + Node 24 + pnpm + SQLite. Every PR must pass on Windows **and** Ubuntu 24.04.

### Definition of done (per PR)

- [ ] `pnpm -r typecheck` green
- [ ] `pnpm -r build` green
- [ ] `pnpm -r test` green (Windows + Ubuntu via CI)
- [ ] New behavior has at least one test
- [ ] Docs updated if user-visible (`SETUP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md`)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## Unreleased`
- [ ] No new top-level `getLogger()` calls (see v0.4 #9)
- [ ] No new hand-rolled API types in `apps/web` after v0.5 #2

- [ ] Each webhook path rejects another vendor's signature.
- [ ] Same local-day brief twice = cache hit across UTC midnight.
- [ ] No module calls `getLogger()` at top level (grep check in CI).

### Out of scope

Streaming, Decisions page, MCP server surface, `sqlite-vec`, VPS cutover, generated web client.

---

## 2. v0.5 — Close the loop  *(streaming, Decisions, UI polish, contract types)*

**Goal.** Daily surfaces feel live: streaming answers, typed client, Decisions end-to-end, optimistic captures.

### PRs

**Merge order:** 1 → 2 → 7 → 8 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 11 → 9 → 6 → 10

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `hub ask --stream` prints tokens incrementally; Ctrl-C aborts server within 500ms.
- [ ] `GET /api/captures?q=foo` FTS-ranked, <50ms on 10k rows.

- [ ] Router property test: `sensitivity=high ⇒ vendor !== 'anthropic'` across 10k samples.
- [ ] Spend = 80% fires exactly one ntfy per window; 100% still hard-stops.
- [ ] `hub undo <run-id>` restores R1 runs; second invocation no-op.
- [ ] Dashboard polling stops when tab hidden.
- [ ] `apps/web/src/api.ts` has zero hand-rolled types.
- [ ] Total tests ≥ 140.

### Out of scope

MCP server surface, `sqlite-vec`, R2/R3 consent, light theme, iOS PWA, Notion write-back, Martin ingestion.

## 3. v0.6 — Hub-as-MCP-server  *(+ first external consumer)*

**Goal.** Claude Desktop can call `hub.*` tools against the running server; memory search is real; R2/R3 consent gates live.

### PRs

| # | Title | Scope | LOC | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `feat(mcp): hub-server package (stdio)` | new `packages/mcp-server/` | ~450 | M | [ ] |

| 10 | `feat(settings): /healthz + MCP health + secret rotation UI` | `pages/Settings.tsx`, admin routes behind re-auth | ~350 | M | [ ] |

**Merge order:** 1 → 2 → 8 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 10 → 9

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Claude Desktop stdio config calls `hub.status` / `hub.capture` round-trip.
- [ ] `sqlite-vec` loads on Windows arm64 **or** falls back to FTS-only with one warning.
- [ ] `hub.search_memory` p95 < 200ms on 10k captures.
- [ ] Nightly brief quotes actual capture bodies (golden snapshot).
- [ ] R2 tool → ntfy approve/deny; 60s no-response = deny; logged in `mcp_consents`.
- [ ] R3 requires fresh consent each call.
- [ ] Settings page rotates `HUB_UI_TOKEN` live; old cookies invalid.
- [ ] VPS cutover runbook executed on staging droplet; smoke passes.
- [ ] Total tests ≥ 180.

### Out of scope

Notion write-back, Martin bidirectional, multi-user, light theme, iOS PWA polish.

---

## 4. v0.7 — Ingestion & capture breadth  *(sketched)*

**Goal.** Every real capture source is first-class and dedup/classification is trustworthy.

### Candidate PRs (refine before starting)

- [ ] Martin AI email-forward ingestion (parse, dedup, link to thread).
- [ ] Granola real HMAC path end-to-end (PR in v0.4 #6 laid groundwork).
- [ ] Plaud audio capture: store blob, queue whisper locally.
- [ ] Superwhisper iOS shortcut → webhook with `x-hub-secret`.
- [ ] `projects` table wired: auto-link captures to project by rule or embedding.
- [ ] Classifier v2: include recent captures context, quality eval harness.
- [ ] Capture review queue in web UI (approve/reclassify/merge duplicates).
- [ ] Export: `hub export --since 2026-01-01 --format jsonl`.

### Probable acceptance

- [ ] All five webhook sources have a golden-file test.
- [ ] Dedup recall ≥ 0.95 on a labeled fixture.
- [ ] Classifier agreement vs. fixture ≥ 0.9.

---

## 5. v0.8 — Notion bridge  *(sketched)*

**Goal.** Structured DBs in Notion are read/writable from Hub without violating the reconcile rules.

### Candidate PRs

- [ ] `packages/notion` client (read-only first).
- [ ] Sync: Notion Areas/Projects/People/SOPs → SQLite mirror tables (read-only).
- [ ] `hub.notion_lookup` MCP tool.
- [ ] Write-back for Decisions (Obsidian primary, Notion mirror).
- [ ] Write-back for Open Loops (Notion primary, Obsidian link back).
- [ ] Conflict policy doc in `DECISIONS.md`.

### Probable acceptance

- [ ] No write without a corresponding Obsidian log entry.
- [ ] Round-trip test: create in Hub → appears in Notion → edit in Notion → mirror updates.

---

## 6. v0.9 → v1.0 — Agents, schedule, polish  *(sketched)*

**Goal.** Move from "I run `hub brief` manually" to a believable personal OS.

### Themes

- **Scheduler:** migrate `node-cron` agents to Anthropic Routines where cloud scope is fine; keep local-only on `node-cron`.
- **Agents:** nightly review, weekly review, inbox-zero helper, project-status digest.
- **Routing:** model-cost telemetry per agent; auto-demote agents that don't need Opus.
- **Mobile:** validate PWA install on iOS; push via ntfy verified end-to-end.
- **Voice:** Superwhisper default; quick-capture shortcut benchmarked.
- **Backups:** `deploy/backup.sh` tested on real VPS, restore rehearsed.
- **Observability:** pino → log rotation + optional OTLP exporter (off by default).
- **Threat model refresh:** `SECURITY.md` walkthrough after MCP server is public.

### v1.0 readiness gate

- [ ] Used daily for 30 consecutive days without manual DB surgery.
- [ ] Backup restored from cold storage successfully.
- [ ] Spend ceiling tripped and recovered at least once.
- [ ] All R2/R3 surfaces have a consent audit trail.
- [ ] Privacy-router property test still passes.
- [ ] No `TODO(security)` / `FIXME(privacy)` comments in repo.

## 7. V1+ / don't-build-yet

Parked deliberately. Each needs a trigger before we start.

| Item | Trigger to reconsider |
|---|---|
| LangGraph / Mastra / CrewAI | >15 agents or need visual traces |
| Voyage / OpenAI embeddings default | fastembed recall <0.7 on real corpus |
| Native `drizzle-orm/node-sqlite` swap | upstream stable release |
| Prisma / Redis / Docker / Postgres | multi-node requirement (won't happen solo) |
| Martin bidirectional adapter | 2+ months of email-forward usage data |
| Notion write-back for Meetings | after v0.8 reconcile rules proven |
| Multi-user / team mode | second human user exists |
| Light theme + iOS PWA polish | daily iOS usage becomes blocker |
| Custom vector DB (Qdrant, LanceDB, Chroma) | corpus > 100k documents |
| Self-hosted auth (Authelia) | share the hub with anyone |
| CLI TUI with `ink` | interactive flow needs panes |
| LLM-generated migrations | schema changes outpace manual writing |

---

## 8. Cross-cutting debt tracker

Edit in place. Move to a milestone when picked up.

- [ ] `drizzle-orm/sqlite-proxy` async contract — keep, revisit on upstream
- [ ] `tsx watch` bug — workaround in place (`chore/server-dev-workaround`)
- [ ] `embeddings` table exists, `sqlite-vec` not installed — v0.6 #3

- [ ] `projects` unwired — v0.7
- [ ] `rawContentRef` in brief context — v0.6 #5
- [ ] Hand-rolled `apps/web/src/api.ts` types — v0.5 #2
- [ ] No rate limit on `/auth/login` — v0.4 #5
- [ ] `HUB_UI_TOKEN` defaults to cookie HMAC — v0.4 #4
- [ ] `dayStartMs()` UTC — v0.4 #8
- [ ] 4× duplicated vitest `node:sqlite` shim — v0.4 #2
- [ ] Top-level `getLogger()` — v0.4 #9
- [ ] Drizzle-vs-raw-sqlite policy undocumented — v0.4 #10
- [ ] Desktop Commander in default MCP scope — v0.4 #11 + v0.6 #8
- [ ] No CI — v0.4 #1
- [ ] Dashboard polls when backgrounded — v0.5 #10
- [ ] No streaming / skeletons / toasts / optimistic — v0.5 #3–#5, #10
- [ ] No search on Captures — v0.5 #5
- [ ] Settings read-only — v0.6 #10
- [ ] Dark-only theme — V1+
- [ ] PWA iOS install unvalidated — v0.9

---

## 9. Security checklist  *(re-verify each milestone)*

- [ ] `HUB_COOKIE_SECRET` ≠ `HUB_UI_TOKEN` in prod (v0.4 #4)
- [ ] Rate limit on `/auth/login` (v0.4 #5)
- [ ] Per-vendor webhook signatures (v0.4 #6)
- [ ] Dependabot enabled (v0.4 #1)
- [ ] Pino redact list matches `SECURITY.md`
- [ ] `Desktop Commander` MCP allowlist enforced (v0.4 #11, v0.6 #8)
- [ ] Consent audit trail for R2/R3 (v0.6 #6)
- [ ] Secret rotation path exercised (v0.6 #10)
- [ ] Backup+restore rehearsed (v0.9)

---

## 10. Changelog discipline

- Every PR updates `CHANGELOG.md` under `## Unreleased`.
- On milestone close: rename `## Unreleased` → `## v0.X - YYYY-MM-DD`, tag, push tag.
- `DECISIONS.md` gets one entry per reversed-or-committed architectural choice. Append-only.
- `ROADMAP.md` (this file) gets edited in place; history lives in git.
